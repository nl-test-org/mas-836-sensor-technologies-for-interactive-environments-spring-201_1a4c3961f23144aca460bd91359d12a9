Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Goals
------------

The overall goal of this course is for students to attain a broad familiarity with many different sensors useful in a broad definition of "HCI" (Human-Computer Interaction)

*   Develop judgment of what sensors and modalities are appropriate for different applications
*   Know how to electronically condition the sensor, hook it up to a microcomputer, and process the signal (at least basically)
*   Have some idea of how/where these sensors were used before
*   Have a reasonable idea of how different sensors work
*   Develop a sense for recognizing bad data and an intuition of how to resolve problems

Coursework and Grading
----------------------

This course combines lecture and lab-based instruction. Students are required to complete several problem sets and labs, and a project due at the end of the term with a final report and in-class presentation.
